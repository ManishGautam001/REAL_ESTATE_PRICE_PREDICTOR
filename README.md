## Model Deployed at :https://realestateprediction.herokuapp.com/

1. This is a project regarding "Home price prediction" of real estate company and i have collected raw data from KAGGLE.COM.

2. Then i uploaded my csv file into jupyter notebook for analysis.

3. After uploading data i started Data Cleaning such as removal of missing values or replaced with median.

4. For more analysis i have drawn some histograms.

5. After completion of analysis i started 'train-test split' method for dividing data.

6. Then i generate pipeline for some preprocessing such as "imputer,standardscale".

7. Ater all data analsis process i started selection of model.

8. For more accuracy i generate cross validation method on different models.

9.Then i decided my model with less root mean squared error.

10. After choosing model i fit my training data into model.

11. Then i tested my data and the accuracy of my data is 87.9%.

12. Then i saved my model as "pickle file" in my computer.

The tools used in this project is listed below,
1. Jupyter Notebook as IDE.
2. Pandas and Numpy.
3. Matplotlib for Visualization.
4. Sklearn for Machine Learning.
5. Pickle.
